Here's some basic text.

And here's some *itatlics*

Here's some **bold** text.

What about a [link](https://github.com/4theKnowledge)

here';s a bulleted list:
* First item
+ second item
- third item

NBumber list:

Python code block
```python
    import numpy as np

    def test(x, y):
        return x+y
```

here's some inline code `x+y`.

here's an image:
<img src="{{ site.url}}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/pytorch-basic-rnn/RNN-LSTM-GRU.png" alt="Some image I've added...">

here's some math

$$z=x+y$$

You can also put it inline $$z=x+y$$
